## Remaining Project Tasks: A Detailed Guide

With the backend API and database implementation (Task 3) now complete, we can focus on the remaining key areas: Frontend Development (Task 4), Testing (Task 5), and Deployment (Task 6).

### Task 4: Frontend Development

**Goal:** Build a user-friendly web interface that allows users to interact with the prediction market platform through the backend API.

**Sub-Tasks:**

1. **Set up the Frontend Development Environment:**
   - **Verify Node.js and npm/yarn:** Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
   - **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to your `frontend` directory and install the necessary dependencies (e.g., React, Redux/Context, any UI libraries).
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install  # or yarn install
     ```
2. **Define Frontend Routes and Navigation:**
   - **Plan Application Structure:** Decide on the different pages or views your application will have (e.g., market listing, market details, order placement, portfolio).
   - **Implement Routing:** Use a routing library (like React Router) to define the navigation between these views.
3. **Implement UI Components:**
   - **Market Listing Component:**
     - Fetch market data from the `/api/markets` endpoint.
     - Display markets in a table or card format, showing key information (question, expiry, status, current price).
     - Implement sorting and filtering options.
   - **Market Details Component:**
     - Fetch details for a specific market using the `/api/markets/{market_id}` endpoint.
     - Display market information, order book (see below), and recent trades (see below).
   - **Order Book Component:**
     - Fetch order book data (you might need to create a specific backend endpoint for this or derive it from open orders).
     - Display buy and sell orders, showing price and amount.
     - Implement real-time updates (using WebSockets if possible).
   - **Recent Trades Component:**
     - Fetch recent trades for a market using the `/api/markets/{market_id}/trades` endpoint.
     - Display trades with price, amount, and timestamp.
     - Implement real-time updates (using WebSockets if possible).
   - **Order Placement Component:**
     - Create forms for placing buy and sell orders.
     - Integrate with the `/api/markets/{market_id}/orders` POST endpoint.
     - Handle form validation and display success/error messages.
   - **Portfolio View Component:**
     - Fetch user positions using the `/api/users/{user_address}/positions` endpoint.
     - Display the user's positions for each market, including token balances and PnL.
     - Fetch user stats using the `/api/users/{user_address}/stats` endpoint.
     - Display user statistics (total trades, volume, PnL).
   - **Market Creation Component (if applicable):**
     - Create a form for creating new markets.
     - Integrate with the `/api/markets` POST endpoint.
     - Handle form validation.
   - **Token Management Component:**

     - Implement UI for burning tokens, calling the `/api/markets/{market_id}/burn` POST endpoint.
   - **Claim Winnings Component:**
     - Implement a button or mechanism to claim winnings for resolved markets, calling the `/api/users/{user_address}/positions/claim` POST endpoint.
4. **Implement State Management:**
   - **Choose a State Management Solution:** Select a state management library (e.g., React Context, Redux, Zustand) or use React's built-in state management.
   - **Manage Application Data:** Store and manage data like market lists, user positions, order book data, and user authentication status.
5. **Integrate with Backend API:**
   - **Create API Service Functions:** Create functions or services to handle API calls to your backend. Use libraries like `fetch` or `axios`.
   - **Handle API Responses:** Process the responses from your backend API, including success and error scenarios.
6. **Implement Wallet Integration:**
   - **Choose a Wallet Integration Library:** Select a library that helps with connecting to Hyperliquid-compatible wallets.
   - **Implement Wallet Connection:** Allow users to connect their wallets.
   - **Handle Transaction Signing:** When users perform actions that require blockchain transactions (e.g., placing orders, minting/burning), use the wallet integration to get user signatures.
7. **Implement Real-time Updates (if applicable):**
   - **Set up WebSockets:** If you've implemented WebSockets on the backend, connect to the WebSocket server from the frontend.
   - **Handle Real-time Data:** Update the UI in real-time when new data is received (e.g., order book updates, new trades).
8. **Styling and User Experience:**
   - **Apply Styling:** Style your components using CSS, a CSS framework (like Tailwind CSS or Material UI), or styled components.
   - **Focus on User Experience:** Ensure the application is intuitive and easy to use.

### Task 5: Testing

**Goal:** Ensure the quality and reliability of the application through comprehensive testing.

**Sub-Tasks:**

1. **Frontend Testing:**
   - **Unit Tests:**
     - **Identify Testable Units:** Determine the individual components and functions that can be tested in isolation.
     - **Write Unit Tests:** Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha with React Testing Library to write unit tests for your components and logic. Focus on testing the UI rendering, component behavior, and state updates.
   - **Integration Tests:**
     - **Test Component Interactions:** Write integration tests to verify how different frontend components work together. For example, test the interaction between the market listing and market details components.
     - **Mock API Calls:** Mock API calls to isolate frontend logic from the backend during integration testing.
   - **End-to-End Tests:**
     - **Set up an End-to-End Testing Environment:** Use a framework like Cypress or Playwright to set up an environment for end-to-end testing.
     - **Write End-to-End Tests:** Simulate user workflows (e.g., creating an account, placing an order, claiming winnings) to test the entire application flow, including interactions with the backend.
2. **Backend Testing:**
   - **Unit Tests:**
     - **Test Individual Functions and Modules:** Write unit tests for your backend handlers, services, and utility functions.
